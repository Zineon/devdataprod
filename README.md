This app uses the *diamonds* dataset available in RStudio. It uses the `r ggplot2` package to generate scatterplots of the various columns describing the diamonds against each other, in addition to using the different variables as facets in the both row and column forms. The app draws a sample from the original dataset with the help of a slider input from the user.
