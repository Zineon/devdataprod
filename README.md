This app uses the **diamonds** dataset available from the `ggplot2` package. It uses the `ggplot2` package to generate scatterplots of the various columns describing the diamonds against each other, in addition to using the different variables as facets in both row and column forms. The app draws a sample from the original dataset with the help of a slider input from the user.
